## Description

This page works as a portfolio of my work in web development. I wanted to make the page easy to navigate and clear. While maing this portfolio web page I got to learn some more about html and CSS. CSS was probably the most difficult part of this project for me, as I am still learning the ins and outs, and things didn't always work the way I wanted them to.
